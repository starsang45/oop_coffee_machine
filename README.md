# OOP Coffee Machine
This project is a Python-based simulation of a coffee machine, implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It allows users to select and purchase different types of coffee while managing resources and processing payments.

# Features
Menu Options: Offers three types of coffee: Espresso, Latte, and Cappuccino.
Resource Management: Tracks the availability of ingredients like water, milk, and coffee beans.
Payment Processing: Accepts payments in the form of coins and calculates change if necessary.
Reporting: Provides a report of current resources and total earnings.
User Interaction: Allows users to order drinks, check machine status, and turn off the machine.
